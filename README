This program was turned in for course credit for

CS3700/Computer Networks
at Metropolitan State University of Denver

by Randy Sorensen in Spring of 2013.

The project was to create a working web server in Java and a
command line client that could interact with the server.

The server defaults to port 8080. It can be used to serve my
project's documentation to a web browser:

	cd HTTPServer
	java HTTPServer ../doc

Then, load this in your browser:

	http://localhost:8080/

The server offers a number of command line argument options, which
include setting the port (-p PORT) and displaying the full HTTP
request headers as received (-s). The option -h will display a
full usage summary.

The server knows to append "index.html" so it should work like
any ordinary website.

There is a simple, command-line based HTTP client in the
HTTPClient subdirectory; it was designed to interact with the
provided server, but it could interact with any server just as
readily. It asks the user for all necessary information, such as
the name and port of the server and which document to ask for in
the GET request.
